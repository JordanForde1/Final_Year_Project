# Final-Year-Project
This is my my final year project polling system for the upcoming repeal the 8th referendum.

This project is a polling and data visualization information system that will be used by the public and the campaigners. The project will gather data for the upcoming repeal the 8th referendum and display it as a heat map of Ireland. A heat map is a way of displaying data over a certain area with colours. Red represents high concentrations and blue will represent low concentrations. The data eill also be shown as simple graphs and progress bars in the site. The public will fill out an anonymous poll of specific questions - age, gender, education, constituency, income, ethnicity and Religion. This will allow the campaigners to think of new strategies and where to apply them and allow the public the see how the country is voting.

The problem presented with this project is that there is too much data scattered instead of being contained in one place. When taking polls on the street it can be very hard to get people to stop and to talk to them. This web application will take data from people who want to vote, and can be shared on social media. This data is taken and displayed as simple bar charts and contained in spread sheets. 

The data needs to be visualized in such a way where the person seeing it can understand it and its magnitude without being over whelmed. The data is important for both groups - the public and the campaigners. When conducting a campaign on either side, a strategy is needed to accomplish their goal. This data would provide a way to carry out this strategy in areas of deficiency. This project gives the campaigners the information they need so there is no need for hours of research and they can focus on their task. 

The solution to the topics mentioned is the functionality of the web application. The web application will allow both the public and the campaigners to easily see the data that has been gathered. The public polling survey will be very straight forward and intuitive.  
The next element will be seeing the votes over a heat map of Ireland.

The features of the information gathered in one place and the ability to vote from anywhere is the key selling point of this project and is what sets it aside from other polls done previously. There is also more information gathered about everyone who has voted. This information is contained and visualized all in this web application.
